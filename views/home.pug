  | The goal of FlushRush is to assist the public in finding public restrooms when they are in an unfamiliar area. The app allows users to view public restrooms that are nearby and view ratings for things such as cleanliness, traffic in and out, and quality of toilet paper. Users also have the ability to add new restrooms to the list if a restroom is not already listed.
